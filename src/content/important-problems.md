# Important Problems

Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve wanted to be a hero.

It all started with 5-year-old me wanting to be the first person to actually dress up and fight crime like Batman. After all, I thought, why _couldn't_ someone do that?

As I grew older though, I realised that real heros were people like [Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug) and [Yuan Longping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Longping). People who spent their entire lives working in the hope that they may be able to improve the lives of _millions_ by solving [important problems](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/bookshelf/hamming.html).

Sure, it isn't as sexy as punching bad guys in the face, but to achieve the moral equivalent of stopping someone from [drowning in a pond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine,_Affluence,_and_Morality) every few minutes would have to feel pretty amazing.

While working on my PhD, I was lucky enough to have a lot of time to think seriously about how I could best try to do this. One framework for identifying good problems that I've really come to like is the [80,000 hours framework](https://80000hours.org/make-a-difference-with-your-career/). In short, this framework advocates working on:
* **pressing problems** with 
* **effective solutions** where you can apply
* **strong leverage** and that you are a
* **good personal** fit for.

In my [next post](/posts/supercharging-universities), I'll lay out my reasoning for why I think our mission at FLUX - to _supercharge universities_ - meets the criteria above.
